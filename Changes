0.10  Wed Dec 28 12:40:02 2011
	- Transitional release to support 64-bit OS's. Unfortunately,
	  there are unresolved issues with 64-bit CLI, but the following
	  changes are meant to ease the transition to 64-bit code.
	- Changed handling of connection and request handles. In
	  previous versions, these handles were actually pointers to
	  the Session or Request structs, cast to IV's. Now we pass
	  the actual struct as an SV. Required because under a 64-bit
	  OS a pointer is not necessarily the same size as an int.
	- Changed several longs to Int32, unsigned long to UInt32, etc.
