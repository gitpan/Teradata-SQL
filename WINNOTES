Notes for Teradata::SQL under Windows

I eventually got this module to compile under Windows Server 2003
by performing the following steps. Since I do not pretend to be a
Windows expert, these steps are probably incomplete. Those with
more Windows experience are invited to tie up the loose ends.

1. Install the Teradata CLIv2 libraries (.h and .dll).

2. Install .NET Framework (v1.1 is adequate) and Platform SDK (core),
   if they are not already installed.

3. Unzip and untar the Teradata-SQL package. Run 'unix2dos' or a
   similar program to change the line terminations in all files.

4. Set LIB and PATH.  Following are the paths I eventually had;
   modify as needed for your server.

set LIB=%LIB%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft visual Studio .NET
2003\Vc7\lib;C:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v1.1\lib;C:\Program Files\Micros
oft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\lib;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for
Windows Server 2003 R2\lib;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Co
mmon7\IDE;C:\Program Files\NCR\Teradata Client\cli\lib

path %PATH%;C:\Program
 Files\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v1.1\Bin;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
2003\Vc7\bin;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\
Bin;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Common7\IDE;C:\Program Fi
les\Microsoft visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\lib

5. perl Makefile.PL

6. Modify the Makefile by hand to add 3 library names to the
   end of LDLOADLIBS. This should really be done in Makefile.PL
   somehow.

LDLOADLIBS = ... wincli32.lib tdusr32.lib dbcprims.lib

7. nmake, etc., as usual.
