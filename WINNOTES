Notes for Teradata::SQL under Windows
 
The easiest way to run Teradata::SQL under Windows is to download
the PPM version from CPAN. This works with the ActiveState Perl
Package Manager.

If you need to build the module yourself, you can try the following
steps. Since I do not pretend to be a Windows expert, these steps
are probably incomplete. Those with more Windows experience are
invited to tie up the loose ends.
 
1. Install the Teradata CLIv2 libraries (.h and .dll).
 
2. Install .NET Framework (v1.1 is adequate) and Platform SDK (core)
   if necessary. These are included with recent versions of Windows.
 
3. Unzip and untar the Teradata-SQL package. You may run 'unix2dos' or
   a similar program to change the line terminations in all files, but
   that isn't necessary.
 
4. Set PATH, LIB, and INCLUDE to include the 32-bit libraries. The 
   module has unresolved difficulties with 64-bit CLI. The script I
   used for Windows Server 2003 is shown below; modify as needed
   for your server.
 
5. perl Makefile.PL
 
6. nmake, etc., as usual.
