Notes for Teradata::SQL under Windows

The easiest way to run Teradata::SQL under Windows is to download
the PPM version from CPAN. This works with the ActiveState Perl
Package Manager.

[CPAN mirror]/modules/by-authors/id/G/GR/GROMMEL/

If you need to build the module yourself, you can try the following
steps. Since I do not pretend to be a Windows expert, these steps
are probably incomplete. Those with more Windows experience are
invited to tie up the loose ends.

1. Install the Teradata CLIv2 libraries (.h and .dll).

2. Install .NET Framework (v1.1 is adequate) and Platform SDK (core),
   if they are not already installed.

3. Unzip and untar the Teradata-SQL package. Run 'unix2dos' or a
   similar program to change the line terminations in all files.

4. Set PATH, LIB, and INCLUDE.  The script I use for Windows XP is 
   shown below; modify as needed for your server.

5. perl Makefile.PL

6. Modify the Makefile by hand to add two library names to the
   end of LDLOADLIBS. This should really be done in Makefile.PL
   somehow.

LDLOADLIBS = ... wincli32.lib tdusr32.lib
and maybe dbcprims.lib

7. nmake, etc., as usual.
