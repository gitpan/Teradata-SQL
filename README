Teradata::SQL
=============

Teradata::SQL is a Perl interface to Teradata SQL. It does not attempt
to be a complete interface to Teradata -- for instance, it does not
allow asynchronous requests or PM/API connections -- but it should
be sufficient for many applications.  The syntax is similar to that
of DBI, but this is not a DBI module.  Both BTET and ANSI sessions
are supported.

A SIMPLE EXAMPLE

   $dbh = Teradata::SQL::connect("dbc/bogart,bacall");
   $sth = $dbh->open("select * from edw.sales");
   while ( @row = $sth->fetchrow_list ) {
      ... process the row ...
   }
   $sth->close;
   $dbh->disconnect;

INSTALLATION

Ordinarily, you will need root access to install this or any Perl
module.

Before installing, define an environment variable named TDLOGON.
This should be a user ID on the Teradata server that is able to
select from DBC views. If you wish, you can also define one named
TDDB that names a Teradata database in which you are able to create
and drop tables. This will be used in "make test".

   export TDLOGON=server/user,password
   export TDDB=my_work_database    # Optional

Then, run the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires:

   Perl version 5.6.0 or later
   a C compiler
   CLIv2

The module has been tested on Solaris, MP-RAS, AIX, Linux (SLES and
CentOS), Windows 2003 Server, and WinXP. The Windows support is
incomplete; see WINNOTES.  Those who are able to test it on earlier
versions of Perl or other platforms are welcome to collaborate.

64-BIT SUPPORT

Version 0.10 of the module includes changes intended to support 64-bit
operating systems. Testing on 32-bit Linux was successful. On 64-bit
Linux, most functions work, but parameterized requests (requests with
"?" in the text of the prepared query) do not; they yielded CLI errors
of 328 or 350. For now, the only workarounds are to avoid parameterized
requests or to compile the module on a 32-bit system and transfer the
binaries to a 64-bit system. Help from anyone for this issue will be
gladly received.
